	* pre-remove so link before softlink in LINUXdso action in 
	libtiff/Makefile.in to avoid failure on LINUXdso builds other than
	the first.

	* Fixed problem with cvtcmap() in tif_getimage.c modifying the
	colormaps owned by the TIFF handle itself when trying to fixup wrong
	(eight bit) colormaps.  Corrected by maintaining a private copy of
	the colormap. 

	* Added TIFFReadRGBATile()/TIFFReadRGBAStrip() support in 
	tif_getimage.c.

	* CVS Repository placed at remotesensing.org.  ChangeLog added.
