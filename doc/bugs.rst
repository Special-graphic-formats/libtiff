==============================

This software is free.  Please let us know when you find a problem or
fix a bug.

The project is using `GitLab issues <https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff/issues/>`_
since October 2019.
Previously, the project used MapTools.org
bugzilla to track bugs: remaining tickets in that bugzilla instance have been
migrated to GitLab issues. All bugs filed in a older bugzilla at
bugzilla.remotesensing.org (pre April 2008) have unfortunately been lost. 

If you think you've discovered a bug, please first check to see if it is
already known by looking at the list of already reported bugs. Also verify that 
the problem is still reproducible with the current development software
from GitLab.

If you'd like to enter a new bug, you can do so at
`<https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff/issues/new/>`_

If you'd like to inform us about some kind of security issue that should not
be disclosed for a period of time, then you can contact maintainers directly.
Send a copies of your report to the following people: Frank Warmerdam
`<warmerdam@pobox.com>`_
and
Bob Friesenhahn `<bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>`_.

Of course, reporting bugs is no substitute for discussion.  The 
`<tiff@lists.osgeo.org>`_ mailing list is for users of this software, and
discussion TIFF issues in general.
It is managed with the Mailman software, and the web interface for subscribing
and managing your access to the list is at:

  `<http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/tiff/>`_

Posts to the list are only accepted from members of the list in order
to limit the amount of spam propagated.

A `Long Term Archive <http://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff/tml.html>`_
including recent messages, and most messages back to 1993,
with search capabilities is available, and 
has been prepared and hosted by
`AWare Systems <http://www.awaresystems.be>`_.
