HOWTO-RELEASE: 
Notes on releasing.

1. Commit any unsaved changes. 

2. "make clean"

3. Create html/vX.X.html.  Take ChangeLog entries and html-ify in there. 
   Easist thing to do is take html/vX.(X-1).html and use it as a template. 

3.5. Update html/index.html to refer to this new page as the current release.

4. Add any new files that have been created that should be part 
   of the distribution (like the html file in step 2), to 
   TIFFFILES in Makefile.in

5. Increment version in file "VERSION".  Put Alpha or Beta after the version
   with a space, if applicable. 

   eg.
   3.5.7
    or
   3.5.8 Beta

6. sh configure; make; make install (to test). 

7. make release -- this will update "RELEASE-DATE" in the top level dir,
   libtiff/tiffvers.h and create the .tar.gz and .zip archives one directory 
   above.  

8. Please verify that the version info in libtiff/tiffvers.h is right.
